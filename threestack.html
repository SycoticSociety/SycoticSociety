      <p>Our first ever NFT collection of only 100 units!
         it was so much fun learning how to create NFT's!
          Once I got the hang of it, I quickly realized 
            there was no turning back. Holders save 7%
             on buy in fees when this NFT is in their
                       wallet. Let's go!</p>

              I'm so glad I did not allow my fear to

      <h4><b>Born from the gaming revolution!</b></h4>
      <h6><i>The thrill of victory, and the agnony of defeat.</i></h6>
      <p>As a young man I can clearly remember the first gaming console my father bought me.  We were living in Puerto Rico at the time.  I was
       roughly nine years old at the time.  Honestly, I really couldn't believe he actually bought it for me.  In those days a 8 bit system ran 
         about $235.00.  Which was basically a small fortune as far as I was concerned.  The drive home took forever, or so it seemed.  The 
     anticipation was basically killing me.  Once we arrived home, I dashed inside sat on the floor and started shifting through all the contents.
     Everything almost seemed alien to me.  Needless to say, I figured it out!  The Connection was complete!  My television went from a old run          down scrambled screen, to a technological powerhouse!  I was immediately ported to another world.  Suddenly, I could feel my neurons were
     firing rapidly.  I could feel myself gettimg warmer.  Real physical changes were actually taking place inside me.  Little did I realize, I
     would never be the same.
     
     Years had passed, and there was little end in sight.  I started collecting game after game.  Playing arcade games at local pizza parlors, and
     corner stores.  The techno-Boom had arrived!  To Be Continued!!!
